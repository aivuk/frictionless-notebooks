Since 2010 the legal framework for the protection of personal data has been developed in the country (1). The chronology is as follows: in 2013 a bill was proposed on the processing and use of personal data in the Federal Senate; in 2015 the project proposal was approved; in 2017, other projects began to be processed in the Chamber and Senate; the General Personal Data Protection Law was enacted in August 2018; in 2019, the creation of the National Data Protection Authority was approved; the general protection law entered into force in August 2020 (2).\n\nLaw no. 13.709, of August 14, 2018, General Law for the Protection of Personal Data provides citizens with control over the treatment of their data, through principles and rules that must be observed by private and public organizations.\n\nThe main foundations (3) of the law respect for, informative self-determination, freedom of expression, information, communication, and opinion; inviolability of intimacy, honor, and image; economic and technological development and innovation; free enterprise, free competition, and consumer protection; human rights, the free development of personality, dignity and the exercise of citizenship by natural persons.\n\nThe law provides under which circumstances the processing of data can be carried out, distinguishes personal data from sensitive data, determines the rights of the data subject regarding the processing, collection, and control; establishes the principles of data processing by the government; creates two people to control, operate and respond to data processing, the person in charge and the controller (3).\n\nThe general law was modified to create compliance guidelines and the oversight body. Law no. 13,853, of July 8, 2019 (4) established measures to ensure compliance with data protection rules, created the National Data Protection Authority, a body linked to the Presidency of the Republic, and the National Council for the Protection of Personal Data and Privacy.\nThe authority is responsible for drafting the guidelines for the National Policy for the Protection of Personal Data and Privacy; monitor and apply sanctions in case of non-compliance with the law or irregularities. The authority must promote knowledge of the norms for the population, safety and security policies, and cooperate with authorities in other countries.\n\nThe National Council for the Protection of Personal Data and Privacy acts as a consultation body for the national authority, proposing guidelines, providing subsidies for the creation of national policy, preparation of studies, debates, and public hearings (4). The Council is composed of members of civil society and public authorities, who were recently selected through a public notice (5).\n\n\nSource:\n(1) LUGATI, L.N.; ALMEIDA, J.E. de.

The legislation came into force in August 2020. In July 2019, law n.13953 amended the LGPD and created the National Authority for the Protection of Personal Data (2). The created body must implement, supervise and ensure compliance with the law in the national territory. The LGPD was inspired by the General Data Protection Regulation (European Union). The law regulates the processing of personal data on digital media, either by a natural person or by a legal person under public or private law. The aim is to protect the fundamental rights of freedom and privacy. The law defines data categories; determines the possibilities of collection, processing of data, purpose, and need for requesting and using personal data; establishes the rights of data subjects, including for special conditions of sensitive data and segments of the population; establishes the obligations towards companies, a differentiated regime for the Public Power; determines the creation of a national authority to establish sanctions in case of violations, guidelines, alerts and any type of penalties; citizen guarantee system to request that data be deleted or revoked at any time. The law institutes three important figures: the Controller, the Operator, and the Supervisor. Organizations must have agents responsible for the processing of data with functions determined according to the size and volume of data processed. Therefore, Brazilian law guarantees the choice and consent, access and correction to the data, demands responsibility from data holders, and rights of reparation.\nIt is important to emphasize that the defense of values \u200b\u200bof privacy, data protection, intimacy, and inviolability of communications already had a relative guarantee through the following laws: Marco Civil da Internet that developed human rights in digital media, consumer protection law, etc.\nAfter the LGPD was in force, it was approved from the structure of regulations of the National Authority through decree n.10,474 of 2020. The decree created the board of directors with a mandate period and attributions of the directors.\nThe National Authority for the Protection of Personal Data has technical and decision-making autonomy to supervise and develop guidelines and norms related to the protection, collection, use, storage, and distribution of personal data of Brazilian citizens. In January 2021, the Authority's ordinance 11 of 2021 established a Regulatory Agenda, determined the creation of the Internal Regulation and the Strategic Planning for the 2021-2023 triennium.\n\nSource:\n(1) General Personal Data Protection Law available at http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2015-2018/2018/Lei/L13709.htm\n(2)Personal Data Protection Authority available at: https://www.gov.br/anpd/pt-br/documentos-e-publicacoes/planejamento- estrategico/planejamento-estrategico-2021-2023.pdf"], ["Brazil", "Elements", ""], ["Brazil", "Rights and responsibilities:", ""], ["Brazil", "The framework provides data subjects with rights of choice or consent.", "Yes"], ["Brazil", "2;Please indicate which section of the framework refers to this issue.", "Articles 5 and 7 of the General Data Protection Law (LGPD) establish the legal bases for a person's data to be processed by a company or institution, to protect the fundamental rights of freedom and privacy of its holder.
